# **Harmonia Components**  
**Elegant, structured, and reusable React components for modern web applications.**

## 🧭 Motivation  

In many projects, similar UI elements are repeatedly rebuilt — leading to redundant code, inconsistent designs, and wasted time.  
Harmonia Components solves this by offering:  

- **Efficiency** – Reuse pre-built components to speed up development.  
- **Consistency** – Maintain a unified design language across multiple projects.  
- **Maintainability** – Update components in one place and reflect changes everywhere.
