# Eunomia UI

**Elegant, structured, and reusable React components for modern web applications.**

Eunomia UI is a modular component library built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn UI**. It offers a collection of accessible, themeable, and developer-friendly components designed to accelerate your development workflow.

## 🧭 Motivation

The primary motivation behind Eunomia UI is to establish a centralized repository of reusable components. In past projects, rebuilding similar UI elements led to redundant code and inconsistent designs. By creating this library, the goal is to:

- **Enhance Efficiency**: Develop faster by reusing pre-built components.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain a uniform design language across projects.
- **Simplify Maintenance**: Update components in one place, reflecting changes everywhere.
